            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm the 21<sup>-year-old</sup> son of a Carny. My dad owned the games on a traveling midway, that over the years, grew into one of Canada's leading midways. As a result, I get to sell lemonade at the RBC bluesfest and see all the concerts for free. I saw Snoop Dogg, Wu-Tang Clan, T-Pain, America, and even met <em>The Killers!</em></p>
            <p>Since the pandemic struck however, there is a chance the business might not survive. We are petitioning the government to provide loans to out of work midway owners, or else county fairs, fall fairs, and pretty much all fairs except the CNE could stay gone after this is all over. If the carnival doesn't come back, I'll be pretty bummed, but luckily I found a decent job on a vineyard over the summer that can keep me funded until I'm skilled enough at Media Design to make some real money.</p>
